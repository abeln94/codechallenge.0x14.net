# Challenge 1 - Roll the dice!

## Explanation
Just a warmup problem: split each line by ':' and add both sides +1 (unless they add to 12, in which case the output is '-').

## Notes
For some reason the file I saved doesn't have comments, but I remember writing them in all challenges. I have redone them again, but may differ from the actual submission.
