No source code this time.

1) Open wireshark, load the pcap file.

multiple packages, all seems to contain a single byte of data, 
the protocol says that a IP packet is split and sent.

2) Extract all the data, concatenate as bin hex, load in wireshark again ... nothing

After a bit of testing and documentation, see the sequence number not in order.
I guess the avian carriers were lazy.

3) Sort the packets by sequence number.

4) Extract all the data, concatenate as bin hex, load in wireshark again ... nothing

Notice the binary file...its a qr

5) Scan the qr. Bingo!
