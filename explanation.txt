1) Picture without alpha, no alpha hidden
2) PNG with valid IEND at the end, no hidden data
3) Tested some color modifications, nothing obvious, the line seem to be a specific greyscale
4) The line is a separate colorspace, and without aliasing (the rest of the image is). Something hidden here.
5) Made a program to traverse the line and report the pixels in order
6) Trying to convert the pixels to something in binary that when decoded produces something

7) After lots (LOTS) of tests, the git first commit is output???? what????
8) New tablet, now in color, just a bit of tweaking of the traversal algorithm and I'm good to go
9) Same git output, but now the payload is a random bytecode, what if I write is as file...
10) Aja! It's a gzip (the header 1f  8b  08). Another tablet, third tweak...
11) Another compressed text
