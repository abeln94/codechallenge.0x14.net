This repository contains all the files I made while solving the challenge.
All the files of each challenge are prefixed by C{index}. There is an explanation of how I solved the challenge (CX_explanation.md), in most cases a kotlin code file (CX_main.kt), and the rest are input/output data required for the program (most of them obtained from the challenge page itself).
The git history tells with more details when I solved each, and maybe other interesting changes. I was only able to spend time on afternoons after work, and I solved the last one a few hours before the deadline. In the end I failed 3 challenges. One because I didn't notice a failure on my algorithm (fixable with a one-line), other which I couldn't solve for very hard inputs (not present in the test phase) and another because I literally removed a space while cleaning the code (and this was an impossible-to-fail challenge because the test and submit phases were the same, but that space made the submission wrong). Ranking position 19. It was a hard but very engaging and interesting contest.

If you want to run any of the files just clone the repository or copy the files and set them in the src/main/kotlin of a new project. Then, either move the non-kotlin files to the root folder, or run the programs directly in that folder as a working directory. You can also try running them on Kotlin playground, but some modifications to read input from code instead of file will be probably required.

Also, feel free to ask any questions, either as an issue, as a discussion or even an email. [Pueden ser también en español, que en realidad es mi lengua materna, el uso del inglés es por costumbre a la hora de programar]
