This repository contains all the files I made while solving the challenge.
All the files of each challenge are prefixed by C{index}. There is an explanation of how I solved the challenge (CX_explanation.md), in most cases a kotlin code file (CX_main.kt), and the rest are input/output data required for the program (most of them obtained from the challenge page itself).
The git history tells with more details when I solved each, and maybe other interesting changes.

If you want to run any of the files just clone the repository or copy the files and set them in the src/main/kotlin of a new project. Then, either move the non-kotlin files to the root folder, or run the programs directly in that folder as a working directory.

Feel free to ask any questions, either as an issue, as a discussion or even an email. [Pueden ser en español, que en realidad es mi lengua materna, el uso del inglés es por costumbre a la hora de programar]
